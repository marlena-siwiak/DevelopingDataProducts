<h1>Body Mass Index Calculator Help</h1>

<h3>What is the Body Mass Index?</h3>
<p>The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a number calculated from a person's weight and height. BMI provides a reliable indicator of body fatness for most people and is used to screen for weight categories that may lead to health problems.</p>

<h3>How to calculate BMI?</h3>
The BMI for a person is defined as their body mass divided by the square of their height - with the value universally being given in units of kg/m2.

<h3>How to run the calculator?</h3>
Type your weight and height into apprioprate boxes and choose their units from lists below. Hit the "submit" button. The default units are kilograms for weight and meters for height, but you can choose, e.g., pounds and inches instead, or some other non-standard units. The server makes all the necessary unit conversions. In case of height in m&m candies, the diameter of an m&m candy is considered as its height.

<h3>How to interpret the outcome?</h3>
After submiting, the application displays your BMI along with its interpretation according to WHO standards, as present at the <a href="http://apps.who.int/bmi/index.jsp?introPage=intro_3.html">WHO website</a>.
